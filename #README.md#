# Monitoring of the Piggott Wind Turbine Generator (APSM)

Generator failures of the Piggott Wind Turbine can be detcted by applying electircal signature analysis (ESA). In my Masterthesis I deployed ESA to detect rotor deviation, which is a typicall generator failure when the wheel bearing srew becomes loose.
The Fulltext of the Master Thesis is available on TU Wien Library's website: [Link](

Due to the fact, that the language of the master thesis is German I want to give a short summary in English and I want to provide the raw data and analysis scripts for further research.

This repository holds:
- Simulation of the deviated rotor with FEMM
- Measured raw Voltage Signal (open circuit terminal voltage)
- RMS Analysis
- Fourier Analysis
- Zero-Crossing Timing Analysis

The outcomes are:
- Rotor deviation is detectable by
  - RMS Voltage
  - harmonics
- the rotation angle can be dervied from the voltage 

Thanks to Jonathan Schreiber for all the talks and technical support.
