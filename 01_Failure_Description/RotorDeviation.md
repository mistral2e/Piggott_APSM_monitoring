Members of the Wind Empowerment Community told me about bearing problems appearing after long operating times. In particular is the loosening of the bearing screw a severe failure. When this screw gets loose the rotor of the wind turbine bents down towards the ground. But it will move only a little bit, because very soon the rotor's magnets will touch the stator. Then when the wind turbine starts turning, the sharp edges of the magnets will destroy the thin isolation of stator.

## Rotor Deviation vs. Stator Deviation
In the following the described failure is called rotor deviation. The drawing shows the APSM with the pivot point in the bearing, the blue colored rotor and teh orange colored stator.

If you want to loose the bearing screw manually it needs some time because you have to dissasemble the front rotor magnet disk. A way more easy is to deviate the stator by adjusting the nuts. I called this stator deviation. The pivot point is then located in the middle of the stator. In consequence the geometry of the stator deviation differs in several ways from the rotor deviation! Mainly because when the rotor is deviated its vertical position is 1 mm below the original state.
